## Android Health Connect Deep Integration (September 2025)

### Problem Solved
Android Health Connect permissions were not navigating to the correct settings page on Samsung devices and other Android 14+ devices. The generic error message was confusing users.

### Technical Implementation
1. **Native Android Methods** (`MainActivity.kt`)
   - `openHealthConnectSettings()`: Version-aware navigation to Health Connect settings
   - Android 14+: Uses `ACTION_MANAGE_HEALTH_PERMISSIONS` intent
   - Android 13-: Uses `ACTION_HEALTH_CONNECT_SETTINGS` intent
   - Samsung-specific handling for deep system integration

2. **Device Detection**
   - Implemented `getDeviceInfo()` method to detect Samsung devices
   - Returns device manufacturer and Android SDK version
   - Used for providing device-specific guidance

3. **User Guidance Widget** (`AndroidHealthPermissionGuide`)
   - Device-specific instructions for permission setup
   - Samsung devices: Navigate through Settings → Apps
   - Other devices: Direct Health Connect app access
   - Visual step-by-step guidance

4. **Files Modified**
   - `/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/streaker/streaker/MainActivity.kt`
   - `/lib/services/unified_health_service.dart`
   - `/lib/widgets/android_health_permission_guide.dart` (new)
   - `/lib/services/health_onboarding_service.dart`

### Key Insights
- Samsung devices have Health Connect deeply integrated at system level (similar to iOS HealthKit)
- Different Android versions require different intent actions
- User guidance significantly improves permission grant success rate

## Health Connect Permission Flow Fixes (December 2024)

### Critical Issues Resolved
**Problem:** Samsung Health Connect popup was not opening settings correctly and required double confirmation. OTP input fields were invisible on certain device themes.

### Technical Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Samsung-Specific Health Connect Handling
**Root Cause:** Samsung devices integrate Health Connect at system level differently than standard Android
**Solution:**
- Added Samsung device detection in `MainActivity.kt:1860-1902`
- Implemented Samsung Health permission manager intent:
  ```kotlin
  setClassName(
    "com.samsung.android.shealthpermissionmanager",
    "com.samsung.android.shealthpermissionmanager.PermissionActivity"
  )
  ```
- Returns `"settings_opened"` status instead of immediate permission check
- Enhanced fallback chain for different Android versions and manufacturers

#### 2. Permission Flow Lifecycle Management
**Root Cause:** Dialog state management and app lifecycle conflicts during permission requests
**Solution:**
- Created `PermissionFlowManager` service (`/lib/services/permission_flow_manager.dart`)
- Implements `WidgetsBindingObserver` for app lifecycle tracking
- Prevents navigation state loss during settings transitions
- Manages permission flow states: idle → requesting → inSettings → completed/failed
- Stream-based state updates for real-time UI synchronization

#### 3. Dialog Management Overhaul
**Root Cause:** Multiple dialogs competing and improper lifecycle handling
**Solution:**
- Complete rewrite of dialog handling in `home_screen_clean.dart:449-467`
- Integrated permission request directly into dialog callback
- Proper dialog closing based on permission flow completion
- Enhanced waiting dialogs with state-aware auto-closing
- Prevention of duplicate popups through flow state tracking

#### 4. OTP Input Visibility Fix
**Root Cause:** Theme-dependent text colors causing invisible digits on dark themes
**Solution:**
- Forced styling in `otp_verification_screen.dart:172-241`
- White background (`Colors.white`) with explicit black text (`Colors.black87`)
- Enhanced container decoration with box shadows for depth
- Proper cursor styling: `cursorColor: Colors.black, cursorWidth: 2, showCursor: true`
- Removed theme inheritance for critical input fields

#### 5. Auto-Permission Request Removal
**Root Cause:** Health permissions being requested immediately after OTP authentication
**Solution:**
- Modified `health_provider.dart:125-129` to remove auto-permission requests
- Changed from automatic to user-initiated permission flow
- Eliminated unwanted redirects after authentication
- Improved user control over when to connect health data

### Key Files Modified
- `/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/streaker/streaker/MainActivity.kt` - Samsung-specific settings handling
- `/lib/services/permission_flow_manager.dart` - New lifecycle management service
- `/lib/screens/main/home_screen_clean.dart` - Dialog management overhaul
- `/lib/screens/auth/otp_verification_screen.dart` - Input visibility fixes
- `/lib/providers/health_provider.dart` - Removed auto-permission requests
- `/lib/services/health_onboarding_service.dart` - Enhanced permission handling
- `/lib/services/unified_health_service.dart` - Better error handling
- `/lib/main.dart` - Permission flow integration

### Technical Achievements
- Eliminated double popup confirmations
- Fixed Samsung S22 Ultra specific permission issues
- Resolved OTP input invisibility across all themes
- Enhanced user experience with proper feedback during permission flows
- Implemented robust error handling for different Android manufacturers
- Added app lifecycle state preservation during settings navigation

### Testing Results
- Successfully tested on Samsung S22 Ultra (R5CT32TLWGB)
- Fixed both reported issues: popup navigation and OTP visibility
- Proper settings opening with user feedback
- Smooth permission flow without navigation disruption

## Codebase Analysis (September 2025)

### Identified Issues
1. **Duplicate Providers**: Both local and Supabase versions exist
   - Impact: ~200KB redundant code
   - Files: auth, user, nutrition providers

2. **Multiple Screen Versions**
   - Active: `home_screen_clean.dart`, `progress_screen_new.dart`
   - Unused: `home_screen.dart`, `progress_screen.dart`
   - Note: Using "new" versions, not originals

3. **Redundant Health Services**
   - Active: `unified_health_service.dart`
   - Unused: `health_service.dart`, `flutter_health_service.dart`, `native_health_connect_service.dart`

4. **Non-Flutter Directories**
   - `/node_modules` (7.4MB) - Not needed
   - `/website` (876KB) - Separate project

5. **Documentation Overflow**
   - 44 markdown files in root directory
   - Multiple SQL test files

### Build Impact Analysis
- **Good News**: Flutter's tree-shaking excludes unused code
- **iOS Build Size**: 33.9MB (reasonable for feature set)
- **Main Impact**: Repository size and developer experience
- **No significant runtime impact**

### Recommendations
- Clean up for code hygiene, not build size
- Move documentation to `/docs`
- Remove `/node_modules` and `/website`
- Delete truly unused screen versions
- Consolidate test SQL files

## Home Page Metrics Integration (September 26, 2025)

### Recent Critical Fixes

#### 1. Calorie Display Issue
**Problem**: Home page showing total calories (4369) instead of active calories (2761)
**Solution**:
- Changed from `dailyCaloriesTarget` to `dailyActiveCaloriesTarget` in `home_screen_clean.dart:399`
- Force reload profile data from Supabase on app initialization
- Added debug logging to trace actual values being loaded

#### 2. Nutrition Data Not Loading
**Problem**: Calories Left section showing "0 kcal" despite having nutrition entries
**Solution**:
- Added `nutritionProvider.loadDataFromSupabase()` call on app init (line 49-53)
- Changed display format to "consumed/target" (e.g., "2914/2361 kcal")
- Implemented weight loss deficit calculation: activeTarget - 400

#### 3. Data Flow Architecture

**Steps Metric**:
- Source: `HealthProvider.todaySteps` → `UnifiedHealthService`
- Target: `profiles.daily_steps_target`
- Display: `{steps}/{target}` (e.g., "10221/10000")

**Calories Burn**:
- Source: `HealthProvider.todayTotalCalories`
- Target: `profiles.daily_active_calories_target`
- Display: `{burned}/{target}` (e.g., "1979/2761 kcal")

**Calories Left (Nutrition)**:
- Source: `NutritionProvider.todayNutrition.totalCalories`
- Target: `activeCaloriesTarget - 400` (weight loss deficit)
- Display: `{consumed}/{target}` (e.g., "2914/2361 kcal")

**Streak Metrics**:
- Current: `StreakProvider.currentStreak`
- Record: `StreakProvider.longestStreak`
- Database: `streaks` table

### Key Technical Details

**Provider Architecture**:
```dart
SupabaseUserProvider: Profile data and targets
HealthProvider: Device health metrics
NutritionProvider: Food tracking data
StreakProvider: Streak and achievement data
```

**Database Tables**:
- `profiles`: User targets and settings
- `health_metrics`: Daily health data
- `nutrition_entries`: Food consumption
- `streaks`: Streak tracking

**Sync Strategy**:
- Health data: 5-minute intervals via RealtimeSyncService
- Nutrition: Real-time on entry
- Profile: Force reload on app init
- Streaks: Real-time updates

### Testing Verification
✅ All metrics display correct database values
✅ Targets load from user profile
✅ Nutrition data persists and loads correctly
✅ Weight loss deficit calculation working (2761 - 400 = 2361)
✅ Data syncs to Supabase properly
